# amazing-albums-admin

This is an administrative dashboard being constructed for my [amazing-albums](https://github.com/Fayhen/amazing-albums) project. It enables easy management of the Firestore database on a privileged context, separated from the client application.

Stacks consist of a [Nest](https://nestjs.com/) API orchestrating the [firebase-admin SDK](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-admin-node), and an [Astro](https://astro.build/) frontend for graphical interface.

This is a work in progress.
